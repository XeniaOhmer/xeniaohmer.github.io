My name is Xenia and I am currently doing a Postdoc at the Institute of Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück. 
I work in the Natural Language Processing Group under the supervision of [Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/).

Research interests
-------------------
I am interested (and have published on) different topics related to Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics:

- Evaluation and interpretation of large language models 
- Language emergence and multi-agent communication
- Using deep neural networks for modeling cognitive phenomena

Short bio
-----------
I studied *Cognitive Science* in my Bachelor's at the University of Osnabrück and the University of Zürich (ERASMUS), and *Mathematics in Medicine and Life Sciences* in my Master's at the University of Lübeck. 
After a brief stint as a researcher in the field of Computational Molecular Biology, I returned to Osnabrück to do my Ph.D. in the Research Training Group *Computational Cognition*, under supervision of [Peter König](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/research_groups/neurobiopsychology/pk.html), Professor for "Neurobiopsychology", and [Michael Franke](https://michael-franke.github.io/heimseite/), who is now a Professor at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Tübingen.
During my Ph.D. I worked on different projects about neural network models of word learning, multi-agent communication, language emergence, and pragmatics. I started my Postdoc in the Natural Language Processing Group (still University of Osnabrück), under supervision of Elia Bruni this February. While I am still interested in and working on projects related to the topics of my Ph.D. I am very excited about the recent developments in NLP and increasingly also working on the evaluation and interpretation of large language models. 


News
-------
- 18.07.23 - Very proud to be part of the [#that_is_good_data](https://github.com/huggingface/that_is_good_data) intiative. You can report any mistakes you find in current NLP benchmarks, together with ideas how to fix them. 
- 23.05.23 - New [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11662) with [Dieuwke Hupkes](https://dieuwkehupkes.nl/) and [Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/): We propose to evaluate Large Language Models on different _forms_ of the same task to test whether they have a "true" task understanding. Turns out, ChatGPT does not so well... 
- 13.04.23 - I successfully defended my dissertation today :-) A link to the thesis will follow as soon as it is officially published (which requires overcoming various hurdles posed by German bureaucracy).
- 31.03.23 - New [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/mqzgr/) with [Christine Cuskley](https://ccuskley.github.io/):  We reduce different traditions for modelling language evolution through dyadic agent interactions to the same skeletal dynamics, and highlight how variations on these skeletal dynamics can lead to convergent but also complementary results.
